# CRUD Operations Demo

This is a simple project demonstrating how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using PostgreSQL as the database and Node.js as the backend language. The project dynamically updates input fields based on the selected operation and displays a table showing the data changes after each operation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Input Fields:** The input fields change based on the selected operation (e.g., select, update).
  - **Select Operation:** Prompts for `name` and `address` input fields.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js (there is another branch with PHP)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
